**Database Management System (DBMS)**
is software designed to define, perform operations on, retrieve, and manage data within a database.

**Relational Database Management System (RDBMS)**
is a type of database management system that is based on the relational model of data, such as MySQL, Oracle, SQL Server...

**Structured Query Language (SQL)**
is a standard programming language used for managing and manipulating relational databases.

| Data Type | Description |
|---|---|
| Character |  - **CHAR** : store fixed-length character strings with a predetermined length. - **VCHAR**: store variable-length character strings. - **TEXT**: store character strings with a length larger than CHAR and VARCHAR (> 255). - **NCHAR**:  is similar to CHAR but is used to store Unicode character strings. - **NVARCHAR**: is similar to VARCHAR but is used to store Unicode character strings. - **NTEXT**: is similar to TEXT but is used to store long Unicode character strings. |
| Numeric | -**Exact Numeric**: numeric/int-tinyint-smallint-bigint/decimal/money-smallmoney/bit. -**Appropriate Numeric**: float/real |
